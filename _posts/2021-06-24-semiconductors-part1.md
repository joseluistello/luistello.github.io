### Semiconductors industry it's a complex industry.

We know that semiconductor industry is essential for the civilization and his development and advancement. We could not be reading this article without this industry. We could not imagine all this progress without their contributions. But understand this monster it's hard.

**That's why I created this project.** 

I'm going to publish 2 parts of the same project. 

For me, the goal of this first part consists on show you my knowledge on quant analysis, statistical learning aka machine learning and writing.

For you, this part consists in understanding how the industry works and its performance over the years.

The first part is divided into 4 points:

* Write a short introduction about the business model that exist in the industry 
* Write about the FOX Index
* Select the companies that we will be analyzing throughout the project
* Create models around the data and plot some nice visualizations
